# BookMyShow-Clone
This a clone of the popular ticket booking site, BookMyShow.


BookMyShow is an online ticket booking platform for various events like concerts, movies, sporting events, etc. What it does is that it maintains an online server, a graphical user interface and a billing platform. With the help of GUI, a user can navigate their website and select an event, book his/her ticket by entering his/her details and then make payment. BookMyShow maintains a database of events, upcoming and past. Each event has its own details like when it is going to happen, at what location the event will take place, how many tickets can be booked, how many people have booked their tickets, etc. In this project we have tried to implement this model of maintaining a database, and providing a minimalistic GUI to user where he/she can enter his/her details. However, we have skipped the billing platform as it was too complex to implement.
